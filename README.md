WORKING WITH YOUR OWN REMOTE
============================

Authentication
--------------

Most hosted remote repositories, e.g. GitHub, will offer at least HTTPS and SSH as ways of authenticating when you are pushing and pulling changes

###HTTPS
Authenticating to remote repositories with HTTPS is simple - you authenticate with a username and password.  Some Git GUI clients will remember your username and password for you.

HTTPS is a bit simpler to get started with on Windows.

###SSH on Windows

SSH is a little more work to set up on Windows, but offers a similar experience to HTTPS
